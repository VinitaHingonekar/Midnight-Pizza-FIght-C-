Midnight Pizza Fight is a fun and quirky console-based game where you, the Dough Master, must recover your stolen pizza from the villainous Crust Bandit. Engage in turn-based combat where you can either attack the enemy with your Dough Slapper or heal yourself with an Espresso Shot. Battle through random damage boosts, heal boosts, and strategic decisions to reclaim the honor of Italian cuisine!
